# Health-Care-Analysis
Using Hive And Hadoop
DESCRIPTION : In this, project I took Health Care Dataset dataset from Kaggle. Using the GUI of Ambari I have uploaded the file into HDFS. Then I wrote the file into a table which was created in hive. After importing file into the table in hive I performed some queries through which I want to do the analysis. I took the output of the queries and exported them into HDFS. From HDFS I exported the output files into database system using Sqoop.
